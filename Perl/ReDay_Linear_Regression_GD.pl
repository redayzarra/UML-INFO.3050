Assignment 2 - Complex Perl Program 

Instructions: I want you to choose something not too simple, but not something too hard for you
either. When figuring out what 'moderate complex' means to you, remember I am only
giving you a short time to write this code (2 weeks), so err on the side of easier rather
than harder. That will be OK. Remember, I prefer higher quality code, complete work,
than a more ambitious, but incomplete or rushed work. 

Requirements: I prefer a high quality to high quantity.
